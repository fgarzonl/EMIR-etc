Sky files for the EMIR-ETC

These files have been calculated using ESO's skycalc tool with the default
parameters including a thermal emission source of 280K and an Emissivity = 0.5. 

This setup is chosen to reproduce measured sky values on La Palma:

Band  Measured    SkyCalc estimate (at airmass = 1.0)
  Y     18.0             17.57
  J     16.6             16.85
  H     14.4             14.41
  K     12.5             12.56
