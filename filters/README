Description: README for ETC filters

Filter files must conform to some standards:

Naming convention 
File organisation:

unitx
unity
col_x col_y
i    0.0
... 
N    0.0

This is to trim down the operations the ETC performs and to make sure the interpolation
routines do not get any false positives

unitx must be microns
unity must be expressed as a fraction ie. 0% = 0.0, 100% = 1.0
